=head1 NAME

CPANSA::DB - the CPAN Security Advisory data as a Perl data structure, mostly for CPAN::Audit

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This module is primarily used by L<CPAN::Audit>.

	use CPANSA::DB;

	my $db = CPANSA::DB->db;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<db> subroutine returns the CPAN Security Advisory (CPANSA) reports
as a Perl data structure. However, anything can use this.

Each release also comes with a F<.gpg> file that has the signature
for the file. If you cannot confirm that the module file has the
right signature, it might have been corrupted or modified.

This module is available outside of CPAN as a release on GitHub:
L<https://github.com/briandfoy/cpan-security-advisory/releases>.
Each release on GitHub includes an attestation.

There is also a JSON file that provides the same datastructure.

=head2 Subroutines

There is exactly one subroutine:

=over 4

=item * db

Returns the hashref of all the CPANSA reports.

=back

=head1 VERIFYING

This distribution now uses
L<GitHub Attestations|https://github.blog/2024-05-02-introducing-artifact-attestations-now-in-public-beta/>,
which allow you to verify that the archive file you have was made from
the official repo.

You need a GitHub account and the L<gh tool|https://github.com/larsks/ghcli>.

	# download the distro file from GitHub, MetaCPAN, or a CPAN mirror
	$ gh auth login
	...follow instructions...
	$ gh attestation verify CPANSA-DB-20241111.tar.gz --owner briandfoy

Additionally, each release codes with GPG signature that allows you to
verify that this. The key is the same one used when the database was
distributed with L<CPAN::Audit>:

	$ gpg --verify lib/CPANSA/DB.pm.gpg lib/CPANSA/DB.pm
	gpg: Signature made Mon Nov 18 11:00:10 2024 EST
	gpg:                using RSA key 75AAB42CBA0D7F37F0D6886DF83F8D5E878B6041
	gpg: Good signature from "CPAN::Audit (brian d foy) (https://github.com/briandfoy/cpan-audit) <bdfoy@cpan.org>" [ultimate]

This vulnerability is a confirmed HTTP response splitting\x{a0}flaw in CGI::Simple\x{a0}that allows HTTP response header injection, which can be used for reflected XSS or open redirect under certain conditions.  Although some validation exists, it can be bypassed using URL-encoded values, allowing an attacker to inject untrusted content into the response via query parameters.    As a result, an attacker can inject a line break (e.g. %0A) into the parameter value, causing the server to split the HTTP response and inject arbitrary headers or even an HTML/JavaScript body, leading to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS), open redirect or other attacks.  The issue documented in CVE-2010-4410 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-4410 is related but the fix was incomplete.  Impact  By injecting %0A\x{a0}(newline) into a query string parameter, an attacker can:    *  Break the current HTTP header   *  Inject a new header or entire body   *  Deliver a script payload that is reflected in the server\x{2019}s response That can lead to the following attacks:    *  reflected XSS   *  open redirect   *  cache poisoning   *  header manipulation","distribution" =>

"Concierge::Sessions versions from 0.8.1 before 0.8.5 for Perl generate insecure session ids. The generate_session_id function in Concierge::Sessions::Base defaults to using the uuidgen command to generate a UUID, with a fallback to using Perl's built-in rand function. Neither of these methods are secure, and attackers are able to guess session_ids that can grant them access to systems. Specifically,    *  There is no warning when uuidgen fails. The software can be quietly using the fallback rand() function with no warnings if the command fails for any reason.   *  The uuidgen command will generate a time-based UUID if the system does not have a high-quality random number source, because the call does not explicitly specify the --random option. Note that the system time is shared in HTTP responses.   *  UUIDs are identifiers whose mere possession grants access, as per RFC 9562.   *  The output of the built-in rand() function is predictable and unsuitable for security applications.","distribution" => "Concierge-Sessions","fixed_versions" => [">=0.8.5"],"id" => "CPANSA-Concierge-Sessions-2026-2439","references" => ["https://github.com/bwva/Concierge-Sessions/commit/20bb28e92e8fba307c4ff8264701c215be65e73b","https://metacpan.org/release/BVA/Concierge-Sessions-v0.8.4/diff/BVA/Concierge-Sessions-v0.8.5#lib/Concierge/Sessions/Base.pm","https://perldoc.perl.org/5.42.0/functions/rand","https://security.metacpan.org/docs/guides/random-data-for-security.html","https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9562.html#name-security-considerations"],"reported" => "2026-02-16","severity" => undef}],"main_module" => "Concierge::Sessions","versions" => [{"date" => "2026-02-11T23:31:48","version" => "v0.8.1"},{"date" => "2026-02-12T04:02:53","version" => "v0.8.2"},{"date" => "2026-02-12T08:43:53","version" => "v0.8.3"},{"date" => "2026-02-12T09:47:28","version" => "v0.8.4"},{"date" => "2026-02-12T16:49:19","version" => "v0.8.5"},{"date" => "2026-02-13T04:18:00","version" => "v0.8.6"},{"date" => "2026-02-13T15:38:42","version" => "v0.8.7"},{"date" => "2026-02-13T17:47:48","version" => "v0.8.8"},{"date" => "2026-02-13T22:10:44","version" => "v0.8.9"},{"date" => "2026-02-13T22:32:58","version" => "v0.9.0"},{"date" => "2026-02-15T04:14:21","version" => "v0.10.0"},{"date" => "2026-02-15T18:14:32","version" => "v0.11.0"}]},"Config-IniFiles" => {"advisories" => [{"affected_versions" => ["<2.71"],"cves" => ["CVE-2012-2451"],"description" => "The Config::IniFiles module before 2.71 for Perl creates temporary files with predictable names, which allows local users to overwrite arbitrary files via a symlink attack.

Versions prior to 6.15 are subject to a vulnerability which could potentially be exploited to gain privileged access to APIs or poison intermediate caches. It is uncertain how large the risks are, most Perl based applications are served on top of Nginx or Apache, not on the `HTTP::Daemon`. This library is commonly used for local development and tests. Users are advised to update to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade may add additional request handling logic as a mitigation. After calling `my \$rqst = \$conn->get_request()` one could inspect the returned `HTTP::Request` object.

Properties on the Object.prototype are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n","distribution" => "Sidef","fixed_versions" => [],"id" => "CPANSA-Sidef-2019-5428-jquery","references" => ["https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-JQUERY-174006"],"reported" => undef,"severity" => undef},{"affected_versions" => [">=0.06,<=22.07"],"cves" => ["CVE-2014-6071"],"description" => "jQuery 1.4.2 allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via vectors related to use of the text method inside after.\n","distribution" => "Sidef","fixed_versions" => [],"id" => "CPANSA-Sidef-2014-6071-jquery","references" => ["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1136683","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Sep/10","https://help.ecostruxureit.com/display/public/UADCE725/Security+fixes+in+StruxureWare+Data+Center+Expert+v7.6.0"],"reported" => "2018-01-16","severity" => "medium"}],"main_module" => "Sidef","versions" => [{"date" => "2015-06-19T22:56:13","version" => "0.06"},{"date" => "2015-07-07T22:15:05","version" => "0.07"},{"date" => "2015-07-16T17:29:42","version" => "0.08"},{"date" => "2015-07-23T06:30:35","version" => "0.09"},{"date" => "2015-07-24T05:59:07","version" => "0.0900001"},{"date" => "2015-09-07T00:03:50","version" => "0.0900002"},{"date" => "2015-09-16T22:58:56","version" => "0.10"},{"date" => "2015-10-31T07:15:42","version" => "2.10"},{"date" => "2015-11-24T18:52:00","version" => "2.11"},{"date" => "2015-12-10T23:46:41","version" => "2.12"},{"date" => "2015-12-24T09:03:59","version" => "2.13"},{"date" => "2016-01-02T10:53:48","version" => "2.20"},{"date" => "2016-01-14T13:51:33","version" => "2.21"},{"date" => "2016-02-08T03:21:05","version" => "2.22"},{"date" => "2016-03-06T14:33:37","version" => "2.23"},{"date" => "2016-03-24T16:49:45","version" => "2.24"},{"date" => "2016-05-27T20:32:46","version" => "2.25"},{"date" => "2016-06-01T15:48:21","version" => "2.26"},{"date" => "2016-07-29T13:02:29","version" => "2.30"},{"date" => "2016-08-18T22:40:23","version" => "2.300001"},{"date" => "2016-09-08T22:23:21","version" => "2.31"},{"date" => "2016-10-07T19:01:28","version" => "2.32"},{"date" => "2016-11-13T15:40:06","version" => "2.33"},{"date" => "2016-11-17T17:46:34","version" => "2.330001"},{"date" => "2016-12-24T19:58:48","version" => "2.34"},{"date" => "2017-01-30T20:53:41","version" => "2.35"},{"date" => "2017-03-02T08:58:20","version" => "2.36"},{"date" => "2017-04-04T19:53:33","version" => "2.37"},{"date" => "2017-04-22T19:35:52","version" => "3.00"},{"date" => "2017-05-09T22:49:43","version" => "3.01"},{"date" => "2017-06-05T21:56:28","version" => "3.02"},{"date" => "2017-08-27T20:59:15","version" => "3.03"},{"date" => "2017-10-06T01:08:28","version" => "3.04"},{"date" => "2017-11-03T23:04:20","version" => "3.05"},{"date" => "2017-12-08T13:13:05","version" => "3.10"},{"date" => "2018-02-17T11:31:53","version" => "3.15"},{"date" => "2018-05-05T20:49:50","version" => "3.16"},{"date" => "2018-05-30T21:54:08","version" => "3.17"},{"date" => "2018-07-04T20:15:48","version" => "3.18"},{"date" => "2018-07-31T09:11:13","version" => "3.19"},{"date" => "2018-10-13T22:10:15","version" => "3.50"},{"date" => "2019-01-07T00:48:34","version" => "3.60"},{"date" => "2019-03-24T18:15:23","version" => "3.70"},{"date" => "2019-05-18T23:57:28","version" => "3.80"},{"date" => "2019-08-18T09:18:32","version" => "3.85"},{"date" => "2019-12-25T18:38:15","version" => "3.90"},{"date" => "2020-03-22T22:05:56","version" => "3.95"},{"date" => "2020-07-20T16:23:44","version" => "3.96"},{"date" => "2021-01-17T23:11:25","version" => "3.97"},{"date" => "2021-01-18T22:53:11","version" => "v3.97.1"},{"date" => "2021-03-26T16:00:09","version" => "3.98"},{"date" => "2021-09-02T11:47:37","version" => "3.99"},{"date" => "2022-03-27T09:40:38","version" => "22.03"},{"date" => "2022-05-13T08:16:40","version" => "22.05"},{"date" => "2022-07-16T16:52:14","version" => "22.07"},{"date" => "2022-12-01T21:12:53","version" => "22.12"},{"date" => "2023-03-06T12:08:52","version" => "23.03"},{"date" => "2023-05-11T10:10:43","version" => "23.05"},{"date" => "2023-08-29T10:34:43","version" => "23.08"},{"date" => "2023-10-17T05:11:25","version" => "23.10"},{"date" => "2023-11-07T05:18:27","version" => "23.11"},{"date" => "2024-01-06T17:09:42","version" => "24.01"},{"date" => "2024-05-12T07:43:14","version" => "24.05"},{"date" => "2024-11-28T19:18:13","version" => "24.11"},{"date" => "2025-12-21T00:33:44","version" => "25.12"},{"date" => "2026-01-13T18:42:36","version" => "26.01"}]},"SockJS" => {"advisories" => [{"affected_versions" => [">=0.03,<=0.10"],"cves" => ["CVE-2020-11022"],"description" => "In jQuery versions greater than or equal to 1.2 and before 3.5.0, passing HTML from untrusted sources -

When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n","distribution" => "Zabbix-Reporter","fixed_versions" => [],"id" => "CPANSA-Zabbix-Reporter-2019-5428-jquery","references" => ["https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-JQUERY-174006"],"reported" => undef,"severity" => undef},{"affected_versions" => [">=0.06,<=0.07"],"cves" => ["CVE-2014-6071"],"description" => "jQuery 1.4.2 allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via vectors related to use of the text method inside after.\n","distribution" => "Zabbix-Reporter","fixed_versions" => [],"id" => "CPANSA-Zabbix-Reporter-2014-6071-jquery","references" => ["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1136683","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Sep/10","https://help.ecostruxureit.com/display/public/UADCE725/Security+fixes+in+StruxureWare+Data+Center+Expert+v7.6.0"],"reported" => "2018-01-16","severity" => "medium"}],"main_module" => "Zabbix::Reporter","versions" => [{"date" => "2013-03-27T23:01:45","version" => "0.01"},{"date" => "2013-03-29T20:06:46","version" => "0.02"},{"date" => "2013-05-05T11:26:24","version" => "0.03"},{"date" => "2013-05-13T20:38:47","version" => "0.04"},{"date" => "2013-05-21T19:59:56","version" => "0.05"},{"date" => "2013-06-16T12:55:56","version" => "0.06"},{"date" => "2013-09-08T21:14:34","version" => "0.07"}]},"Zonemaster-Backend" => {"advisories" => [{"affected_versions" => ["<7.0.0"],"cves" => [],"description" => "When running the API behind a reverse proxy on the same machine (like it is using the configuration example provided by the GUI) the remote ip might always be localhost even if the query was done from elsewher\n","distribution" => "Zonemaster-Backend","fixed_versions" => [">=7.0.0"],"id" => "CPANSA-Zonemaster-Backend-2021-001","references" => ["https://github.com/zonemaster/zonemaster-backend/issues/838","https://metacpan.org/dist/Zonemaster-Backend/changes"],"reported" => "2021-08-05","severity" => undef},{"affected_versions" => ["<1.0.1"],"cves" => [],"description" => "Potential SQL injection.\n","distribution" => "Zonemaster-Backend","fixed_versions" => [">=1.0.1"],"id" => "CPANSA-Zonemaster-Backend-2015-001","references" => ["https://github.com/zonemaster/zonemaster-backend/issues/25","https://metacpan.org/dist/Zonemaster-Backend/changes"],"reported" => "2015-01-28","severity" => undef}],"main_module" => "Zonemaster::Backend","versions" => [{"date" => "2017-11-02T13:57:24","version" => "2.0.0"},{"date" => "2018-01-12T17:25:15","version" => "2.0.1"},{"date" => "2018-02-23T13:09:41","version" => "2.0.2"},{"date" => "2018-06-25T08:43:15","version" => "2.1.0"},{"date" => "2019-05-24T07:07:47","version" => "4.0.0"},{"date" => "2019-05-31T16:42:26","version" => "4.0.1"},{"date" => "2020-05-01T14:49:55","version" => "5.0.0"},{"date" => "2020-05-15T12:59:00","version" => "5.0.1"},{"date" => "2020-05-22T07:31:56","version" => "5.0.2"},{"date" => "2020-11-09T09:49:51","version" => "6.0.0"},{"date" => "2020-11-10T10:02:13","version" => "6.0.1"},{"date" => "2020-11-18T09:08:50","version" => "6.0.2"},{"date" => "2021-02-09T11:02:57","version" => "6.1.0"},{"date" => "2021-05-31T20:39:03","version" => "6.2.0"},{"date" => "2021-09-18T14:05:03","version" => "7.0.0"},{"date" => "2021-12-06T00:20:51","version" => "8.0.0"},{"date" => "2021-12-20T10:08:13","version" => "8.1.0"},{"date" => "2022-06-10T11:39:25","version" => "9.0.0"},{"date" => "2022-07-08T08:40:31","version" => "9.0.1"},{"date" => "2022-12-19T09:29:40","version" => "10.0.0"},{"date" => "2023-01-31T16:06:19","version" => "10.0.1"},{"date" => "2023-03-01T17:37:05","version" => "10.0.2"},{"date" => "2023-06-21T16:14:40","version" => "11.0.0"},{"date" => "2023-08-08T02:40:32","version" => "11.0.1"},{"date" => "2023-09-08T09:18:30","version" => "11.0.2"},{"date" => "2024-03-18T15:59:50","version" => "11.1.0"},{"date" => "2024-03-28T10:49:24","version" => "11.1.1"},{"date" => "2024-07-01T15:45:21","version" => "11.2.0"},{"date" => "2024-12-09T13:52:41","version" => "11.3.0"},{"date" => "2025-03-04T21:47:49","version" => "11.4.0"},{"date" => "2025-06-26T17:21:54","version" => "11.5.0"},{"date" => "2025-12-19T11:15:27","version" => "12.0.0"}]},"Zonemaster-GUI" => {"advisories" => [{"affected_versions" => [">=1.0.7,<=1.0.11"],"cves" => ["CVE-2020-7676"],"description" => "angular.js prior to 1.8.0 allows cross site scripting.
