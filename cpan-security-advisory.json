When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n","distribution":"Resource-Pack-jQuery","affected_versions":["==0.01"]},{"id":"CPANSA-Resource-Pack-jQuery-2014-6071-jquery","cves":["CVE-2014-6071"],"fixed_versions":[],"severity":"medium","references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1136683","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Sep/10","https://help.ecostruxureit.com/display/public/UADCE725/Security+fixes+in+StruxureWare+Data+Center+Expert+v7.6.0"],"affected_versions":["==0.01"],"distribution":"Resource-Pack-jQuery","description":"jQuery 1.4.2 allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via vectors related to use of the text method inside after.\n","reported":"2018-01-16"}],"versions":[{"version":"0.01","date":"2010-04-19T20:02:13"}]},"Galileo":{"versions":[{"date":"2012-07-30T17:03:42","version":"0.001"},{"date":"2012-07-30T17:38:19","version":"0.002"},{"date":"2012-07-30T20:36:06","version":"0.003"},{"date":"2012-07-31T15:41:59","version":"0.004"},{"date":"2012-08-06T21:26:17","version":"0.005"},{"date":"2012-08-09T20:39:14","version":"0.006"},{"date":"2012-09-10T17:57:20","version":"0.007"},{"version":"0.008","date":"2012-10-27T17:40:15"},{"date":"2012-10-28T18:03:00","version":"0.009"},{"version":"0.01","date":"2012-10-28T18:10:15"},{"version":"0.011","date":"2012-10-31T22:10:19"},{"date":"2013-01-15T15:10:42","version":"0.012"},{"date":"2013-01-15T21:07:00","version":"0.013"},{"date":"2013-01-16T21:37:32","version":"0.014"},{"version":"0.015","date":"2013-01-19T03:59:45"},{"date":"2013-01-26T21:28:59","version":"0.016"},{"version":"0.017","date":"2013-02-05T03:32:32"},{"date":"2013-02-06T02:47:47","version":"0.018"},{"date":"2013-02-06T03:09:27","version":"0.019"},{"version":"0.020","date":"2013-02-11T23:33:00"},{"version":"0.021","date":"2013-02-17T01:24:51"},{"date":"2013-02-17T02:44:14","version":"0.022"},{"version":"0.023","date":"2013-03-04T18:25:01"},{"date":"2013-03-12T15:24:22","version":"0.024"},{"date":"2013-03-12T18:48:22","version":"0.025"},{"version":"0.026","date":"2013-03-15T15:18:18"},{"version":"0.027","date":"2013-04-03T20:04:15"},{"date":"2013-05-14T15:59:46","version":"0.028"},{"date":"2013-06-29T03:30:18","version":"0.029"},{"version":"0.030","date":"2013-08-27T03:43:39"},{"version":"0.031","date":"2013-11-28T18:36:10"},{"version":"0.032","date":"2014-04-06T16:17:22"},{"date":"2014-05-10T19:38:50","version":"0.033"},{"version":"0.034","date":"2014-05-31T13:06:42"},{"version":"0.035","date":"2014-08-16T22:10:46"},{"version":"0.036","date":"2014-08-31T15:31:15"},{"version":"0.037","date":"2014-10-14T04:03:53"},{"version":"0.038","date":"2015-01-25T18:08:54"},{"version":"0.039","date":"2015-09-28T18:25:31"},{"date":"2016-01-07T16:33:46","version":"0.040"},{"date":"2016-08-13T18:15:17","version":"0.041"},{"version":"0.042","date":"2017-03-16T03:14:04"},{"date":"2020-08-06T16:26:58","version":"0.043"}],"advisories":[{"references":["https://metamorfosec.com/Files/Commits/METC-2020-002-Escape_banner_in_Galileo_CMS_v0.042.txt","https://metacpan.org/changes/distribution/Galileo","https://github.com/jberger/Galileo/pull/55/files","https://metamorfosec.com/Files/Advisories/METS-2020-002-A_Stored_XSS_Vulnerability_in_Galileo_CMS_v0.042.txt"],"fixed_versions":[">=0.043"],"severity":"medium","id":"CPANSA-Galileo-2019-7410","cves":["CVE-2019-7410"],"reported":"2020-08-14","affected_versions":["<0.043"],"distribution":"Galileo","description":"There is stored cross site scripting (XSS) in Galileo CMS v0.042.

is a minimalistic C client library for the Redis database. In affected versions Hiredis is vulnurable to integer overflow if provided maliciously crafted or corrupted `RESP` `mult-bulk` protocol data. When parsing `multi-bulk` (array-like) replies, hiredis fails to check if `count * sizeof(redisReply*)` can be represented in `SIZE_MAX`.

is a simple http server class written in perl. Versions prior to 6.15 are subject to a vulnerability which could potentially be exploited to gain privileged access to APIs or poison intermediate caches. It is uncertain how large the risks are, most Perl based applications are served on top of Nginx or Apache, not on the `HTTP::Daemon`. This library is commonly used for local development and tests. Users are advised to update to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade may add additional request handling logic as a mitigation. After calling `my $rqst = $conn->get_request()` one could inspect the returned `HTTP::Request` object. Querying the 'Content-Length' (`my $cl = $rqst->header('Content-Length')`) will show any abnormalities that should be dealt with by a `400` response. Expected strings of 'Content-Length' SHOULD consist of either a single non-negative integer, or, a comma separated repetition of that number. (that is `42` or `42, 42, 42`).

Properties on the Object.prototype are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain.

Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as _proto_, constructor and prototype. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values. Properties on the Object.prototype are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain.
