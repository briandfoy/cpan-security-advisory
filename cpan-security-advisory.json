When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n","id":"CPANSA-JS-jQuery-2019-5428-jquery","affected_versions":["==1.2.3.001"],"cves":["CVE-2019-5428"],"reported":null,"references":["https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-JQUERY-174006"],"distribution":"JS-jQuery","severity":null},{"description":"jQuery 1.4.2 allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via vectors related to use of the text method inside after.\n","fixed_versions":[],"id":"CPANSA-JS-jQuery-2014-6071-jquery","reported":"2018-01-16","cves":["CVE-2014-6071"],"severity":"medium","references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1136683","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Sep/10","https://help.ecostruxureit.com/display/public/UADCE725/Security+fixes+in+StruxureWare+Data+Center+Expert+v7.6.0"],"distribution":"JS-jQuery","affected_versions":["==1.2.3.001"]},{"distribution":"JS-jQuery","references":["https://github.com/jquery/jquery/security/advisories/GHSA-gxr4-xjj5-5px2","https://blog.jquery.com/2020/04/10/jquery-3-5-0-released/","https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.5/","https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/1d61fd9407e6fbe82fe55cb0b938307aa0791f77","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200511-0006/","https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2020-002","https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4693","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VOE7P7APPRQKD4FGNHBKJPDY6FFCOH3W/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QPN2L2XVQGUA2V5HNQJWHK3APSK3VN7K/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-07/msg00067.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202007-03","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-07/msg00085.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rdf44341677cf7eec7e9aa96dcf3f37ed709544863d619cca8c36f133@%3Ccommits.airflow.apache.org%3E","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AVKYXLWCLZBV2N7M46KYK4LVA5OXWPBY/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SFP4UK4EGP4AFH2MWYJ5A5Z4I7XVFQ6B/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SAPQVX3XDNPGFT26QAQ6AJIXZZBZ4CD4/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rbb448222ba62c430e21e13f940be4cb5cfc373cd3bce56b48c0ffa67@%3Cdev.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r706cfbc098420f7113968cc377247ec3d1439bce42e679c11c609e2d@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-11/msg00039.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r49ce4243b4738dd763caeb27fa8ad6afb426ae3e8c011ff00b8b1f48@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2020-10","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2020-11","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2021.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r8f70b0f65d6bedf316ecd899371fd89e65333bc988f6326d2956735c@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r564585d97bc069137e64f521e68ba490c7c9c5b342df5d73c49a0760@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-02","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/03/msg00033.html","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/162159/jQuery-1.2-Cross-Site-Scripting.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/ree3bd8ddb23df5fa4e372d11c226830ea3650056b1059f3965b3fce2@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rede9cfaa756e050a3d83045008f84a62802fc68c17f2b4eabeaae5e4@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/re4ae96fa5c1a2fe71ccbb7b7ac1538bd0cb677be270a2bf6e2f8d108@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r54565a8f025c7c4f305355fdfd75b68eca442eebdb5f31c2e7d977ae@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-10","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html","https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r0483ba0072783c2e1bfea613984bfb3c86e73ba8879d780dc1cc7d36@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html"],"severity":"medium","cves":["CVE-2020-11022"],"reported":"2020-04-29","affected_versions":["==1.2.6.001"],"id":"CPANSA-JS-jQuery-2020-11022-jquery","fixed_versions":[],"description":"In jQuery versions greater than or equal to 1.2 and before 3.5.0, passing HTML from untrusted sources -

confirmed HTTP response splittingÂ flaw in CGI::SimpleÂ that allows HTTP response header injection, which can be used for reflected XSS or open redirect under certain conditions.  Although some validation exists, it can be bypassed using URL-encoded values, allowing an attacker to inject untrusted content into the response via query parameters.    As a result, an attacker can inject a line break (e.g. %0A) into the parameter value, causing the server to split the HTTP response and inject arbitrary headers or even an HTML/JavaScript body, leading to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS), open redirect or other attacks.  The issue documented in CVE-2010-4410 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-4410 is related but the fix was incomplete.  Impact  By injecting %0AÂ (newline) into a query string parameter, an attacker can:    *  Break the current HTTP header   *  Inject a new header or entire body   *  Deliver a script payload that is

Predicable session ids could allow an attacker to gain access to systems.","fixed_versions":[">=0.35"],"id":"CPANSA-Plack-Middleware-Session-2025-40923","affected_versions":["<0.35"],"reported":"2025-07-16","cves":["CVE-2025-40923"],"severity":null,"references":["https://github.com/plack/Plack-Middleware-Session/commit/1fbfbb355e34e7f4b3906f66cf958cedadd2b9be.patch","https://github.com/plack/Plack-Middleware-Session/pull/52","https://metacpan.org/release/MIYAGAWA/Plack-Middleware-Session-0.34/source/lib/Plack/Session/State.pm#L22","https://security.metacpan.org/docs/guides/random-data-for-security.html"],"distribution":"Plack-Middleware-Session"}],"versions":[{"date":"2009-12-15T18:59:13","version":"0.01"},{"date":"2009-12-19T19:27:38","version":"0.02"},{"version":"0.03","date":"2010-01-07T22:12:43"},{"date":"2010-01-30T21:46:53","version":"0.09_01"},{"date":"2010-01-31T07:17:07","version":"0.09_02"},{"date":"2010-02-03T04:46:20","version":"0.09_03"},{"version":"0.10","date":"2010-02-23T03:16:31"},{"date":"2010-02-27T10:47:17","version":"0.11"},{"version":"0.12","date":"2010-07-07T22:55:18"},{"date":"2010-12-22T17:00:14","version":"0.13"},{"date":"2011-03-29T20:50:06","version":"0.14"},{"version":"0.15","date":"2012-09-04T21:16:35"},{"date":"2013-02-10T19:43:11","version":"0.16"},{"date":"2013-02-11T23:45:49","version":"0.17"},{"date":"2013-02-12T10:57:14","version":"0.17"},{"date":"2013-06-24T23:09:39","version":"0.20"},{"date":"2013-10-12T18:42:26","version":"0.21"},{"version":"0.22","date":"2014-08-11T17:18:03"},{"date":"2014-08-11T17:23:40","version":"0.23"},{"date":"2014-09-05T11:48:57","version":"0.24"},{"version":"0.25","date":"2014-09-29T03:07:54"},{"version":"0.26","date":"2015-02-03T08:17:55"},{"date":"2015-02-14T00:52:35","version":"0.27"},{"version":"0.28","date":"2015-02-16T16:30:31"},{"version":"0.29","date":"2015-02-17T23:57:32"},{"date":"2015-03-02T18:25:56","version":"0.30"},{"version":"0.31","date":"2019-02-26T19:01:59"},{"version":"0.32","date":"2019-02-26T21:36:43"},{"date":"2019-03-09T23:19:27","version":"0.33"},{"version":"0.34","date":"2024-09-23T16:54:44"},{"version":"0.35","date":"2025-07-07T22:51:18"},{"date":"2025-07-23T19:02:02","version":"0.36"}],"main_module":"Plack::Middleware::Session"},"Module-Load-Conditional":{"main_module":"Module::Load::Conditional","advisories":[{"id":"CPANSA-Module-Load-Conditional-2016-1238","description":"(1) cpan/Archive-Tar/bin/ptar, (2) cpan/Archive-Tar/bin/ptardiff, (3) cpan/Archive-Tar/bin/ptargrep, (4) cpan/CPAN/scripts/cpan, (5) cpan/Digest-SHA/shasum, (6) cpan/Encode/bin/enc2xs, (7) cpan/Encode/bin/encguess, (8) cpan/Encode/bin/piconv, (9) cpan/Encode/bin/ucmlint, (10) cpan/Encode/bin/unidump, (11) cpan/ExtUtils-MakeMaker/bin/instmodsh, (12) cpan/IO-Compress/bin/zipdetails, (13) cpan/JSON-PP/bin/json_pp, (14) cpan/Test-Harness/bin/prove, (15) dist/ExtUtils-ParseXS/lib/ExtUtils/xsubpp, (16) dist/Module-CoreList/corelist, (17) ext/Pod-Html/bin/pod2html, (18) utils/c2ph.PL, (19) utils/h2ph.PL, (20) utils/h2xs.PL, (21) utils/libnetcfg.PL, (22) utils/perlbug.PL, (23) utils/perldoc.PL, (24) utils/perlivp.PL, and (25) utils/splain.PL in Perl 5.x before 5.22.3-RC2 and 5.24 before 5.24.1-RC2 do not properly remove .

OpenPGP.\n","affected_versions":["==1.6.5.0"],"severity":"medium","distribution":"Alien-GCrypt","references":["https://ibm.github.io/system-security-research-updates/2021/07/20/insecurity-elgamal-pt1","https://ibm.github.io/system-security-research-updates/2021/09/06/insecurity-elgamal-pt2","https://eprint.iacr.org/2021/923","https://git.gnupg.org/cgi-bin/gitweb.cgi?p=libgcrypt.git;a=commit;h=3462280f2e23e16adf3ed5176e0f2413d8861320"],"reported":"2021-09-06","cves":["CVE-2021-40528"]}],"versions":[{"date":"2014-11-19T00:20:20","version":"1.6.2.0"},{"version":"1.6.2.1","date":"2014-11-21T22:25:49"},{"date":"2016-03-11T00:00:36","version":"1.6.5.0"}]},"Zonemaster-Backend":{"versions":[{"date":"2017-11-02T13:57:24","version":"2.0.0"},{"date":"2018-01-12T17:25:15","version":"2.0.1"},{"date":"2018-02-23T13:09:41","version":"2.0.2"},{"date":"2018-06-25T08:43:15","version":"2.1.0"},{"version":"4.0.0","date":"2019-05-24T07:07:47"},{"version":"4.0.1","date":"2019-05-31T16:42:26"},{"version":"5.0.0","date":"2020-05-01T14:49:55"},{"date":"2020-05-15T12:59:00","version":"5.0.1"},{"version":"5.0.2","date":"2020-05-22T07:31:56"},{"version":"6.0.0","date":"2020-11-09T09:49:51"},{"version":"6.0.1","date":"2020-11-10T10:02:13"},{"date":"2020-11-18T09:08:50","version":"6.0.2"},{"date":"2021-02-09T11:02:57","version":"6.1.0"},{"version":"6.2.0","date":"2021-05-31T20:39:03"},{"version":"7.0.0","date":"2021-09-18T14:05:03"},{"version":"8.0.0","date":"2021-12-06T00:20:51"},{"date":"2021-12-20T10:08:13","version":"8.1.0"},{"version":"9.0.0","date":"2022-06-10T11:39:25"},{"version":"9.0.1","date":"2022-07-08T08:40:31"},{"date":"2022-12-19T09:29:40","version":"10.0.0"},{"date":"2023-01-31T16:06:19","version":"10.0.1"},{"version":"10.0.2","date":"2023-03-01T17:37:05"},{"date":"2023-06-21T16:14:40","version":"11.0.0"},{"date":"2023-08-08T02:40:32","version":"11.0.1"},{"version":"11.0.2","date":"2023-09-08T09:18:30"},{"date":"2024-03-18T15:59:50","version":"11.1.0"},{"date":"2024-03-28T10:49:24","version":"11.1.1"},{"version":"11.2.0","date":"2024-07-01T15:45:21"},{"version":"11.3.0","date":"2024-12-09T13:52:41"},{"date":"2025-03-04T21:47:49","version":"11.4.0"},{"version":"11.5.0","date":"2025-06-26T17:21:54"}],"advisories":[{"description":"When

Versions prior to 6.15 are subject to a vulnerability which could potentially be exploited to gain privileged access to APIs or poison intermediate caches. It is uncertain how large the risks are, most Perl based applications are served on top of Nginx or Apache, not on the `HTTP::Daemon`. This library is commonly used for local development and tests. Users are advised to update to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade may add additional request handling logic as a mitigation. After calling `my $rqst = $conn->get_request()` one could inspect the returned `HTTP::Request` object. Querying the 'Content-Length' (`my $cl = $rqst->header('Content-Length')`) will show any abnormalities that should be dealt with by a `400` response. Expected strings of 'Content-Length' SHOULD consist of either a single non-negative integer, or, a comma separated repetition of that number. (that is `42` or `42, 42, 42`). Anything else MUST be rejected.\n"}]},"App-revealup":{"advisories":[{"affected_versions":[">=0.01,<=0.19"],"references":["https://hackerone.com/reports/691977"],"distribution":"App-revealup","severity":"medium","cves":["CVE-2020-8127"],"reported":"2020-02-28","id":"CPANSA-App-revealup-2020-8127-revealjs","fixed_versions":[],"description":"Insufficient

The PID will come from a small set of numbers, and the epoch time may be guessed, if it is not leaked from the HTTP Date header. The built-in rand function is unsuitable for cryptographic usage.  According to RFC 2831, The cnonce-value is an opaque quoted string value provided by the client and used by both client and server to avoid chosen plaintext attacks, and to provide mutual authentication.

When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n","id":"CPANSA-Yote-2019-5428-jquery","affected_versions":[">=0.1011,<=0.1019"],"reported":null,"cves":["CVE-2019-5428"],"severity":null,"references":["https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-JQUERY-174006"],"distribution":"Yote"},{"fixed_versions":[],"description":"jQuery 1.4.2 allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via vectors related to use of the text method inside after.\n","id":"CPANSA-Yote-2014-6071-jquery","cves":["CVE-2014-6071"],"reported":"2018-01-16","distribution":"Yote","references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1136683","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Sep/10","https://help.ecostruxureit.com/display/public/UADCE725/Security+fixes+in+StruxureWare+Data+Center+Expert+v7.6.0"],"severity":"medium","affected_versions":[">=0.1011,<=0.1019"]},{"distribution":"Yote","references":["https://github.com/jquery/jquery/security/advisories/GHSA-gxr4-xjj5-5px2","https://blog.jquery.com/2020/04/10/jquery-3-5-0-released/","https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.5/","https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/1d61fd9407e6fbe82fe55cb0b938307aa0791f77","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200511-0006/","https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2020-002","https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4693","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VOE7P7APPRQKD4FGNHBKJPDY6FFCOH3W/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QPN2L2XVQGUA2V5HNQJWHK3APSK3VN7K/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-07/msg00067.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202007-03","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-07/msg00085.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rdf44341677cf7eec7e9aa96dcf3f37ed709544863d619cca8c36f133@%3Ccommits.airflow.apache.org%3E","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AVKYXLWCLZBV2N7M46KYK4LVA5OXWPBY/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SFP4UK4EGP4AFH2MWYJ5A5Z4I7XVFQ6B/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SAPQVX3XDNPGFT26QAQ6AJIXZZBZ4CD4/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rbb448222ba62c430e21e13f940be4cb5cfc373cd3bce56b48c0ffa67@%3Cdev.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r706cfbc098420f7113968cc377247ec3d1439bce42e679c11c609e2d@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-11/msg00039.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r49ce4243b4738dd763caeb27fa8ad6afb426ae3e8c011ff00b8b1f48@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2020-10","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2020-11","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2021.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r8f70b0f65d6bedf316ecd899371fd89e65333bc988f6326d2956735c@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r564585d97bc069137e64f521e68ba490c7c9c5b342df5d73c49a0760@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-02","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/03/msg00033.html","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/162159/jQuery-1.2-Cross-Site-Scripting.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/ree3bd8ddb23df5fa4e372d11c226830ea3650056b1059f3965b3fce2@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rede9cfaa756e050a3d83045008f84a62802fc68c17f2b4eabeaae5e4@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/re4ae96fa5c1a2fe71ccbb7b7ac1538bd0cb677be270a2bf6e2f8d108@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r54565a8f025c7c4f305355fdfd75b68eca442eebdb5f31c2e7d977ae@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-10","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html","https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r0483ba0072783c2e1bfea613984bfb3c86e73ba8879d780dc1cc7d36@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html"],"severity":"medium","cves":["CVE-2020-11022"],"reported":"2020-04-29","affected_versions":[">=0.1020,<=0.207"],"id":"CPANSA-Yote-2020-11022-jquery","description":"In jQuery versions greater than or equal to 1.2 and before 3.5.0, passing HTML from untrusted sources -

When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n","affected_versions":[">=0.1020,<=0.207"],"references":["https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-JQUERY-174006"],"distribution":"Yote","severity":null,"cves":["CVE-2019-5428"],"reported":null},{"id":"CPANSA-Yote-2014-6071-jquery","description":"jQuery 1.4.2 allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via vectors related to use of the text method inside after.\n","fixed_versions":[],"distribution":"Yote","references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1136683","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Sep/10","https://help.ecostruxureit.com/display/public/UADCE725/Security+fixes+in+StruxureWare+Data+Center+Expert+v7.6.0"],"severity":"medium","cves":["CVE-2014-6071"],"reported":"2018-01-16","affected_versions":[">=0.1020,<=0.207"]},{"affected_versions":[">=0.208,<=0.312"],"distribution":"Yote","references":["https://github.com/jquery/jquery/security/advisories/GHSA-gxr4-xjj5-5px2","https://blog.jquery.com/2020/04/10/jquery-3-5-0-released/","https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.5/","https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/1d61fd9407e6fbe82fe55cb0b938307aa0791f77","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200511-0006/","https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2020-002","https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4693","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VOE7P7APPRQKD4FGNHBKJPDY6FFCOH3W/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QPN2L2XVQGUA2V5HNQJWHK3APSK3VN7K/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-07/msg00067.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202007-03","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-07/msg00085.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rdf44341677cf7eec7e9aa96dcf3f37ed709544863d619cca8c36f133@%3Ccommits.airflow.apache.org%3E","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AVKYXLWCLZBV2N7M46KYK4LVA5OXWPBY/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SFP4UK4EGP4AFH2MWYJ5A5Z4I7XVFQ6B/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SAPQVX3XDNPGFT26QAQ6AJIXZZBZ4CD4/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rbb448222ba62c430e21e13f940be4cb5cfc373cd3bce56b48c0ffa67@%3Cdev.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r706cfbc098420f7113968cc377247ec3d1439bce42e679c11c609e2d@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-11/msg00039.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r49ce4243b4738dd763caeb27fa8ad6afb426ae3e8c011ff00b8b1f48@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2020-10","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2020-11","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2021.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r8f70b0f65d6bedf316ecd899371fd89e65333bc988f6326d2956735c@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r564585d97bc069137e64f521e68ba490c7c9c5b342df5d73c49a0760@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-02","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/03/msg00033.html","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/162159/jQuery-1.2-Cross-Site-Scripting.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/ree3bd8ddb23df5fa4e372d11c226830ea3650056b1059f3965b3fce2@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rede9cfaa756e050a3d83045008f84a62802fc68c17f2b4eabeaae5e4@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/re4ae96fa5c1a2fe71ccbb7b7ac1538bd0cb677be270a2bf6e2f8d108@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r54565a8f025c7c4f305355fdfd75b68eca442eebdb5f31c2e7d977ae@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-10","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html","https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r0483ba0072783c2e1bfea613984bfb3c86e73ba8879d780dc1cc7d36@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html"],"severity":"medium","cves":["CVE-2020-11022"],"reported":"2020-04-29","id":"CPANSA-Yote-2020-11022-jquery","fixed_versions":[],"description":"In jQuery versions greater than or equal to 1.2 and before 3.5.0, passing HTML from untrusted sources -
