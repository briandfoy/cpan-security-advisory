Properties on the Object.prototype are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain.

When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n"},{"id":"CPANSA-Yote-2014-6071-jquery","references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1136683","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Sep/10","https://help.ecostruxureit.com/display/public/UADCE725/Security+fixes+in+StruxureWare+Data+Center+Expert+v7.6.0"],"affected_versions":["==1.02"],"cves":["CVE-2014-6071"],"reported":"2018-01-16","severity":"medium","distribution":"Yote","fixed_versions":[],"description":"jQuery 1.4.2 allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via vectors related to use of the text method inside after.\n"}],"main_module":"Yote"},"Archive-Tar":{"advisories":[{"id":"CPANSA-Archive-Tar-2018-01","references":["https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2018-12015","https://github.com/jib/archive-tar-new/commit/ae65651eab053fc6dc4590dbb863a268215c1fc5"],"affected_versions":["<2.28"],"cves":["CVE-2018-12015"],"reported":"2018-06-12","distribution":"Archive-Tar","severity":"medium","fixed_versions":[">=2.28"],"description":"In Perl through 5.26.2, the Archive::Tar module allows remote attackers to bypass a directory-traversal protection mechanism, and overwrite arbitrary files, via an archive file containing a symlink and a regular file with the same name.\n"},{"fixed_versions":[">1.36"],"description":"Directory traversal vulnerability in the Archive::Tar Perl module 1.36 and earlier allows user-assisted remote attackers to overwrite arbitrary files via a TAR archive that contains a file whose name is an absolute path or has \"..\" sequences.\n","distribution":"Archive-Tar","severity":null,"cves":["CVE-2007-4829"],"reported":"2007-11-02","affected_versions":["<=1.36"],"id":"CPANSA-Archive-Tar-2007-4829","references":["http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=29517","https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=295021","http://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=30380","https://issues.rpath.com/browse/RPL-1716","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/26355","http://secunia.com/advisories/27539","http://osvdb.org/40410","http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-700-1","http://secunia.com/advisories/33314","http://www.ubuntu.com/usn/usn-700-2","http://www.gentoo.org/security/en/glsa/glsa-200812-10.xml","http://secunia.com/advisories/33116","http://www.vupen.com/english/advisories/2007/3755","https://exchange.xforce.ibmcloud.com/vulnerabilities/38285","https://oval.cisecurity.org/repository/search/definition/oval%3Aorg.mitre.oval%3Adef%3A11658"]},{"references":["http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.perl5.porters/2016/07/msg238271.html","http://www.securitytracker.com/id/1036440","http://perl5.git.perl.org/perl.git/commit/cee96d52c39b1e7b36e1c62d38bcd8d86e9a41ab","https://rt.perl.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=127834","http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/92136","http://www.debian.org/security/2016/dsa-3628","https://h20566.www2.hpe.com/portal/site/hpsc/public/kb/docDisplay?docId=emr_na-c05240731","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/DOFRQWJRP2NQJEYEWOMECVW3HAMD5SYN/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/TZBNQH3DMI7HDELJAZ4TFJJANHXOEDWH/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/2FBQOCV3GBAN2EYZUM3CFDJ4ECA3GZOK/","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201701-75","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/7f6a16bc0fd0fd5e67c7fd95bd655069a2ac7d1f88e42d3c853e601c@%3Cannounce.apache.org%3E","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2018/11/msg00016.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/201812-07","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2019-08/msg00002.html"],"id":"CPANSA-Archive-Tar-2016-1238","affected_versions":["<2.10"],"reported":"2016-08-02","cves":["CVE-2016-1238"],"distribution":"Archive-Tar","severity":"high","description":"'(1) cpan/Archive-Tar/bin/ptar, (2) cpan/Archive-Tar/bin/ptardiff, (3) cpan/Archive-Tar/bin/ptargrep, (4) cpan/CPAN/scripts/cpan, (5) cpan/Digest-SHA/shasum, (6) cpan/Encode/bin/enc2xs, (7) cpan/Encode/bin/encguess, (8) cpan/Encode/bin/piconv, (9) cpan/Encode/bin/ucmlint, (10) cpan/Encode/bin/unidump, (11) cpan/ExtUtils-MakeMaker/bin/instmodsh, (12) cpan/IO-Compress/bin/zipdetails, (13) cpan/JSON-PP/bin/json_pp, (14) cpan/Test-Harness/bin/prove, (15) dist/ExtUtils-ParseXS/lib/ExtUtils/xsubpp, (16) dist/Module-CoreList/corelist, (17) ext/Pod-Html/bin/pod2html, (18) utils/c2ph.PL, (19) utils/h2ph.PL, (20) utils/h2xs.PL, (21) utils/libnetcfg.PL, (22) utils/perlbug.PL, (23) utils/perldoc.PL, (24) utils/perlivp.PL, and (25) utils/splain.PL in Perl 5.x before 5.22.3-RC2 and 5.24 before 5.24.1-RC2 do not properly remove .

logic.\n","id":"CPANSA-Spreadsheet-ParseExcel-2023-7101","references":["http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2023/12/29/4","https://github.com/jmcnamara/spreadsheet-parseexcel/blob/c7298592e102a375d43150cd002feed806557c15/lib/Spreadsheet/ParseExcel/Utility.pm#L171","https://github.com/mandiant/Vulnerability-Disclosures/blob/master/2023/MNDT-2023-0019.md","https://https://github.com/haile01/perl_spreadsheet_excel_rce_poc","https://https://metacpan.org/dist/Spreadsheet-ParseExcel","https://https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2023-7101","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2023/12/msg00025.html"],"affected_versions":["<0.66"]}],"main_module":"Spreadsheet::ParseExcel","versions":[{"version":"0.06","date":"2000-10-06T00:33:12"},{"version":"0.07","date":"2000-11-18T03:01:33"},{"date":"2000-11-24T23:59:57","version":"0.08"},{"version":"0.09","date":"2000-12-15T02:58:39"},{"version":"0.10","date":"2001-01-16T00:27:35"},{"date":"2001-01-31T15:09:13","version":"0.11"},{"version":"0.12","date":"2001-02-05T11:37:49"},{"version":"0.13","date":"2001-02-22T22:35:17"},{"date":"2001-03-06T02:14:24","version":"0.15"},{"version":"0.16","date":"2001-03-07T21:50:33"},{"date":"2001-03-12T23:08:09","version":"0.17"},{"version":"0.18","date":"2001-03-17T07:39:42"},{"date":"2001-03-26T11:41:43","version":"0.19"},{"version":"0.20","date":"2001-03-30T11:22:58"},{"date":"2001-04-11T00:12:29","version":"0.201"},{"version":"v0.20.1","date":"2001-04-11T00:17:15"},{"version":"0.21","date":"2001-04-28T02:18:17"},{"date":"2001-04-29T05:37:04","version":"v0.21.1"},{"version":"v0.21.2","date":"2001-05-01T07:23:55"},{"date":"2001-05-05T09:46:39","version":"0.22"},{"date":"2001-05-15T22:20:34","version":"v0.22.1"},{"version":"v0.22.2","date":"2001-05-24T22:12:58"},{"version":"v0.22.3","date":"2001-06-05T22:21:24"},{"date":"2001-06-21T21:38:06","version":"0.23"},{"date":"2001-06-26T03:05:48","version":"0.2301"},{"version":"0.24","date":"2001-07-05T10:44:34"},{"date":"2001-07-13T10:51:35","version":"0.2402"},{"version":"0.2403","date":"2001-07-24T21:45:07"},{"version":"0.2404","date":"2001-12-06T22:01:45"},{"date":"2002-01-28T22:38:34","version":"0.2405"},{"version":"0.2406","date":"2002-04-07T22:20:17"},{"version":"0.2407","date":"2002-04-24T13:05:42"},{"date":"2002-05-09T15:05:41","version":"0.25"},{"date":"2002-06-05T20:57:29","version":"0.26"},{"date":"2002-07-13T22:41:34","version":"0.2601"},{"date":"2002-07-16T02:07:27","version":"0.2602"},{"version":"0.2603","date":"2004-05-30T01:51:09"},{"version":"0.27_01","date":"2006-09-11T09:15:23"},{"date":"2006-09-12T20:55:36","version":"0.27_02"},{"version":"0.27_03","date":"2006-11-02T16:44:10"},{"date":"2007-01-03T15:48:01","version":"0.27"},{"date":"2007-01-07T17:20:30","version":"0.28"},{"version":"0.29","date":"2007-03-29T23:21:14"},{"date":"2007-03-31T15:33:28","version":"0.30"},{"version":"0.31","date":"2007-05-03T02:21:13"},{"date":"2007-05-05T03:56:46","version":"0.32"},{"version":"0.33","date":"2008-09-07T07:47:07"},{"date":"2008-10-24T00:05:35","version":"0.40"},{"date":"2008-10-24T00:18:27","version":"0.33"},{"date":"2009-01-01T20:42:10","version":"0.42"},{"version":"0.43","date":"2009-01-08T02:06:27"},{"date":"2009-01-09T03:37:10","version":"0.44"},{"version":"0.45","date":"2009-01-14T02:19:46"},{"date":"2009-01-20T00:34:23","version":"0.46"},{"date":"2009-01-22T00:39:18","version":"0.47"},{"date":"2009-01-23T07:07:04","version":"0.48"},{"date":"2009-01-24T01:19:12","version":"0.49"},{"date":"2009-08-18T23:30:07","version":"0.50"},{"version":"0.51","date":"2009-08-19T22:08:26"},{"version":"0.52","date":"2009-08-21T18:09:01"},{"version":"0.53","date":"2009-08-24T23:06:49"},{"version":"0.54","date":"2009-08-25T20:24:31"},{"date":"2009-09-30T06:26:08","version":"0.55"},{"version":"0.56","date":"2009-12-10T00:23:50"},{"version":"0.57","date":"2010-01-24T19:18:56"},{"version":"0.58","date":"2010-09-17T18:09:07"},{"version":"0.59","date":"2011-04-06T19:13:26"},{"version":"0.60","date":"2014-02-26T19:58:52"},{"version":"0.61","date":"2014-03-04T18:56:46"},{"version":"0.62","date":"2014-03-05T17:16:00"},{"version":"0.63","date":"2014-03-07T20:47:21"},{"version":"0.64","date":"2014-03-11T17:22:13"},{"version":"0.65","date":"2014-03-18T20:47:23"},{"date":"2023-12-29T01:14:58","version":"0.66"}]},"Cmd-Dwarf":{"main_module":"Cmd::Dwarf","advisories":[{"distribution":"Cmd-Dwarf","affected_versions":["<1.20"],"fixed_versions":[">=1.20"],"description":"JSON

When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n","fixed_versions":[],"severity":null,"distribution":"Sidef","cves":["CVE-2019-5428"],"reported":null,"affected_versions":[">=0.06,<=22.07"],"id":"CPANSA-Sidef-2019-5428-jquery","references":["https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-JQUERY-174006"]},{"references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1136683","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Sep/10","https://help.ecostruxureit.com/display/public/UADCE725/Security+fixes+in+StruxureWare+Data+Center+Expert+v7.6.0"],"id":"CPANSA-Sidef-2014-6071-jquery","affected_versions":[">=0.06,<=22.07"],"reported":"2018-01-16","cves":["CVE-2014-6071"],"distribution":"Sidef","severity":"medium","description":"jQuery 1.4.2 allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via vectors related to use of the text method inside after.\n","fixed_versions":[]}],"main_module":"Sidef","versions":[{"date":"2015-06-19T22:56:13","version":"0.06"},{"version":"0.07","date":"2015-07-07T22:15:05"},{"version":"0.08","date":"2015-07-16T17:29:42"},{"date":"2015-07-23T06:30:35","version":"0.09"},{"date":"2015-07-24T05:59:07","version":"0.0900001"},{"version":"0.0900002","date":"2015-09-07T00:03:50"},{"date":"2015-09-16T22:58:56","version":"0.10"},{"date":"2015-10-31T07:15:42","version":"2.10"},{"date":"2015-11-24T18:52:00","version":"2.11"},{"date":"2015-12-10T23:46:41","version":"2.12"},{"date":"2015-12-24T09:03:59","version":"2.13"},{"date":"2016-01-02T10:53:48","version":"2.20"},{"date":"2016-01-14T13:51:33","version":"2.21"},{"date":"2016-02-08T03:21:05","version":"2.22"},{"date":"2016-03-06T14:33:37","version":"2.23"},{"version":"2.24","date":"2016-03-24T16:49:45"},{"version":"2.25","date":"2016-05-27T20:32:46"},{"version":"2.26","date":"2016-06-01T15:48:21"},{"version":"2.30","date":"2016-07-29T13:02:29"},{"version":"2.300001","date":"2016-08-18T22:40:23"},{"date":"2016-09-08T22:23:21","version":"2.31"},{"version":"2.32","date":"2016-10-07T19:01:28"},{"version":"2.33","date":"2016-11-13T15:40:06"},{"version":"2.330001","date":"2016-11-17T17:46:34"},{"date":"2016-12-24T19:58:48","version":"2.34"},{"date":"2017-01-30T20:53:41","version":"2.35"},{"date":"2017-03-02T08:58:20","version":"2.36"},{"version":"2.37","date":"2017-04-04T19:53:33"},{"version":"3.00","date":"2017-04-22T19:35:52"},{"version":"3.01","date":"2017-05-09T22:49:43"},{"version":"3.02","date":"2017-06-05T21:56:28"},{"version":"3.03","date":"2017-08-27T20:59:15"},{"version":"3.04","date":"2017-10-06T01:08:28"},{"version":"3.05","date":"2017-11-03T23:04:20"},{"version":"3.10","date":"2017-12-08T13:13:05"},{"date":"2018-02-17T11:31:53","version":"3.15"},{"version":"3.16","date":"2018-05-05T20:49:50"},{"version":"3.17","date":"2018-05-30T21:54:08"},{"date":"2018-07-04T20:15:48","version":"3.18"},{"date":"2018-07-31T09:11:13","version":"3.19"},{"date":"2018-10-13T22:10:15","version":"3.50"},{"version":"3.60","date":"2019-01-07T00:48:34"},{"date":"2019-03-24T18:15:23","version":"3.70"},{"version":"3.80","date":"2019-05-18T23:57:28"},{"version":"3.85","date":"2019-08-18T09:18:32"},{"date":"2019-12-25T18:38:15","version":"3.90"},{"version":"3.95","date":"2020-03-22T22:05:56"},{"version":"3.96","date":"2020-07-20T16:23:44"},{"date":"2021-01-17T23:11:25","version":"3.97"},{"date":"2021-01-18T22:53:11","version":"v3.97.1"},{"version":"3.98","date":"2021-03-26T16:00:09"},{"date":"2021-09-02T11:47:37","version":"3.99"},{"version":"22.03","date":"2022-03-27T09:40:38"},{"date":"2022-05-13T08:16:40","version":"22.05"},{"date":"2022-07-16T16:52:14","version":"22.07"},{"version":"22.12","date":"2022-12-01T21:12:53"},{"version":"23.03","date":"2023-03-06T12:08:52"},{"date":"2023-05-11T10:10:43","version":"23.05"},{"version":"23.08","date":"2023-08-29T10:34:43"},{"date":"2023-10-17T05:11:25","version":"23.10"},{"date":"2023-11-07T05:18:27","version":"23.11"},{"version":"24.01","date":"2024-01-06T17:09:42"},{"date":"2024-05-12T07:43:14","version":"24.05"},{"version":"24.11","date":"2024-11-28T19:18:13"},{"date":"2025-12-21T00:33:44","version":"25.12"},{"date":"2026-01-13T18:42:36","version":"26.01"}]},"Crypt-OpenSSL-RSA":{"advisories":[{"cves":["CVE-2024-2467"],"reported":"2024-04-25","distribution":"Crypt-OpenSSL-RSA","severity":null,"description":"A timing-based side-channel flaw exists in the perl-Crypt-OpenSSL-RSA package, which could be sufficient to recover plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher-style attack.

versions before 1.282 for Perl has a HTTP response splitting flaw This vulnerability is a confirmed HTTP response splittingÂ flaw in CGI::SimpleÂ that allows HTTP response header injection, which can be used for reflected XSS or open redirect under certain conditions.  Although some validation exists, it can be bypassed using URL-encoded values, allowing an attacker to inject untrusted content into the response via query parameters.    As a result, an attacker can inject a line break (e.g. %0A) into the parameter value, causing the server to split the HTTP response and inject arbitrary headers or even an HTML/JavaScript body, leading to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS), open redirect or other attacks.  The issue documented in CVE-2010-4410 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-4410 is related but the fix was incomplete.

is a simple http server class written in perl.

Users are advised to update to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade may add additional request handling logic as a mitigation. After calling `my $rqst = $conn->get_request()` one could inspect the returned `HTTP::Request` object. Querying the 'Content-Length' (`my $cl = $rqst->header('Content-Length')`) will show any abnormalities that should be dealt with by a `400` response. Expected strings of 'Content-Length' SHOULD consist of either a single non-negative integer, or, a comma separated repetition of that number. (that is `42` or `42, 42, 42`).

Users of hiredis who are unable to update may set the [maxelements](https://github.com/redis/hiredis#reader-max-array-elements) context option to a value small enough that no overflow is possible.\n","severity":"high","distribution":"Redis-Fast","cves":["CVE-2021-32765"],"reported":"2021-10-04"}]},"BSON-XS":{"versions":[{"version":"v0.2.0","date":"2016-10-25T01:44:04"},{"version":"v0.2.1","date":"2016-10-27T14:29:08"},{"date":"2016-10-27T21:57:22","version":"v0.2.2"},{"date":"2018-05-17T20:38:16","version":"v0.4.0"},{"date":"2018-05-25T17:23:21","version":"v0.4.1"},{"version":"v0.4.2","date":"2018-06-13T14:02:45"},{"version":"v0.4.3","date":"2018-07-10T13:54:25"},{"version":"v0.4.4","date":"2018-09-13T03:31:32"},{"version":"v0.4.5","date":"2018-10-12T01:39:57"},{"version":"v0.4.6","date":"2018-10-12T15:51:36"},{"date":"2018-11-29T22:12:13","version":"v0.6.0"},{"date":"2019-07-12T18:08:23","version":"v0.8.0"},{"version":"v0.8.1","date":"2019-08-13T12:22:17"},{"version":"v0.8.2","date":"2019-12-05T18:59:17"},{"date":"2020-04-13T14:58:34","version":"v0.8.3"},{"date":"2020-08-13T14:54:04","version":"v0.8.4"}],"main_module":"BSON::XS","advisories":[{"references":["https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/05/msg00012.html","https://www.mongodb.com/community/forums/t/mongodb-perl-driver-end-of-life/7890"],"id":"CPANSA-BSON-XS-2025-40906","affected_versions":["<=0.8.4"],"reported":"2025-05-16","cves":["CVE-2025-40906","CVE-2017-14227","CVE-2018-16790","CVE-2023-0437","CVE-2024-6381","CVE-2024-6383","CVE-2025-0755"],"severity":"critical","distribution":"BSON-XS","description":"BSON::XS versions 0.8.4 and earlier for Perl includes a bundled libbson 1.1.7, which has several vulnerabilities.
