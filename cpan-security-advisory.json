versions before 1.282 for Perl has a HTTP response splitting flaw This vulnerability is a confirmed HTTP response splittingÂ flaw in CGI::SimpleÂ that allows HTTP response header injection, which can be used for reflected XSS or open redirect under certain conditions.  Although some validation exists, it can be bypassed using URL-encoded values, allowing an attacker to inject untrusted content into the response via query parameters.    As a result, an attacker can inject a line break (e.g. %0A) into the parameter value, causing the server to split the HTTP response and inject arbitrary headers or even an HTML/JavaScript body, leading to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS), open redirect or other attacks.  The issue documented in CVE-2010-4410 https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2010-4410 is related but the fix was incomplete.

When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n","id":"CPANSA-Yote-2019-5428-jquery","reported":null,"references":["https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-JQUERY-174006"],"distribution":"Yote","fixed_versions":[],"affected_versions":[">=0.1020,<=0.207"],"cves":["CVE-2019-5428"]},{"affected_versions":[">=0.1020,<=0.207"],"distribution":"Yote","fixed_versions":[],"references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1136683","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Sep/10","https://help.ecostruxureit.com/display/public/UADCE725/Security+fixes+in+StruxureWare+Data+Center+Expert+v7.6.0"],"cves":["CVE-2014-6071"],"id":"CPANSA-Yote-2014-6071-jquery","severity":"medium","description":"jQuery 1.4.2 allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via vectors related to use of the text method inside after.\n","reported":"2018-01-16"},{"distribution":"Yote","fixed_versions":[],"affected_versions":[">=0.208,<=0.312"],"references":["https://github.com/jquery/jquery/security/advisories/GHSA-gxr4-xjj5-5px2","https://blog.jquery.com/2020/04/10/jquery-3-5-0-released/","https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.5/","https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/1d61fd9407e6fbe82fe55cb0b938307aa0791f77","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200511-0006/","https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2020-002","https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4693","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VOE7P7APPRQKD4FGNHBKJPDY6FFCOH3W/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QPN2L2XVQGUA2V5HNQJWHK3APSK3VN7K/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-07/msg00067.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202007-03","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-07/msg00085.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rdf44341677cf7eec7e9aa96dcf3f37ed709544863d619cca8c36f133@%3Ccommits.airflow.apache.org%3E","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AVKYXLWCLZBV2N7M46KYK4LVA5OXWPBY/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SFP4UK4EGP4AFH2MWYJ5A5Z4I7XVFQ6B/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SAPQVX3XDNPGFT26QAQ6AJIXZZBZ4CD4/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rbb448222ba62c430e21e13f940be4cb5cfc373cd3bce56b48c0ffa67@%3Cdev.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r706cfbc098420f7113968cc377247ec3d1439bce42e679c11c609e2d@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-11/msg00039.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r49ce4243b4738dd763caeb27fa8ad6afb426ae3e8c011ff00b8b1f48@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2020-10","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2020-11","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2021.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r8f70b0f65d6bedf316ecd899371fd89e65333bc988f6326d2956735c@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r564585d97bc069137e64f521e68ba490c7c9c5b342df5d73c49a0760@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-02","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/03/msg00033.html","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/162159/jQuery-1.2-Cross-Site-Scripting.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/ree3bd8ddb23df5fa4e372d11c226830ea3650056b1059f3965b3fce2@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rede9cfaa756e050a3d83045008f84a62802fc68c17f2b4eabeaae5e4@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/re4ae96fa5c1a2fe71ccbb7b7ac1538bd0cb677be270a2bf6e2f8d108@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r54565a8f025c7c4f305355fdfd75b68eca442eebdb5f31c2e7d977ae@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-10","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html","https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r0483ba0072783c2e1bfea613984bfb3c86e73ba8879d780dc1cc7d36@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html"],"cves":["CVE-2020-11022"],"id":"CPANSA-Yote-2020-11022-jquery","description":"In jQuery versions greater than or equal to 1.2 and before 3.5.0, passing HTML from untrusted sources - even after sanitizing it - to one of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods (i.e. .html(), .append(), and others) may execute untrusted code.

The function does not validate that the length parameter is non-negative. If a negative value (e.g. -1) is supplied, the expression length + 1u causes an integer wraparound, resulting in a zero-byte allocation. The subsequent call to getrandom(data, length, GRND_NONBLOCK) passes the original negative value, which is implicitly converted to a large unsigned value (typically SIZE_MAX). This can result in writes beyond the allocated buffer, leading to heap memory corruption and application crash (denial of service).  In common usage, the length argument is typically hardcoded by the caller, which reduces the likelihood of attacker-controlled exploitation.

The function does not validate that the length parameter is non-negative. If a negative value (e.g. -1) is supplied, the expression length + 1u causes an integer wraparound, resulting in a zero-byte allocation. The subsequent call to chosen random function (e.g. getrandom) passes the original negative value, which is implicitly converted to a large unsigned value (typically SIZE_MAX). This can result in writes beyond the allocated buffer, leading to heap memory corruption and application crash (denial of service).

Neither of these methods are secure, and attackers are able to guess session_ids that can grant them access to systems. Specifically,    *  There is no warning when uuidgen fails. The software can be quietly using the fallback rand() function with no warnings if the command fails for any reason.   *  The uuidgen command will generate a time-based UUID if the system does not have a high-quality random number source, because the call does not explicitly specify the --random option.

Example:  $ mkdir /tmp/poc; echo > \"/tmp/poc/|id\" $ perl -MFile::Find::Rule \\ Â  Â  -E 'File::Find::Rule->grep(\"foo\")->in(\"/tmp/poc\")' uid=1000(user) gid=1000(user)

Properties on the Object.prototype are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain.

Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes, such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be altered, including their magical attributes such as _proto_, constructor and prototype. An attacker manipulates these attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application object prototype of the base object by injecting other values. Properties on the Object.prototype are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain.
