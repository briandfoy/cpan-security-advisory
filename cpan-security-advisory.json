Properties on the Object.prototype are then inherited by all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n","cves":["CVE-2019-5428"],"severity":null,"affected_versions":["==1.2.3.001"],"reported":null,"distribution":"JS-jQuery"},{"distribution":"JS-jQuery","reported":"2018-01-16","affected_versions":["==1.2.3.001"],"cves":["CVE-2014-6071"],"severity":"medium","description":"jQuery 1.4.2 allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via vectors related to use of the text method inside after.\n","fixed_versions":[],"references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1136683","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Sep/10","https://help.ecostruxureit.com/display/public/UADCE725/Security+fixes+in+StruxureWare+Data+Center+Expert+v7.6.0"],"id":"CPANSA-JS-jQuery-2014-6071-jquery"},{"fixed_versions":[],"references":["https://github.com/jquery/jquery/security/advisories/GHSA-gxr4-xjj5-5px2","https://blog.jquery.com/2020/04/10/jquery-3-5-0-released/","https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.5/","https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/1d61fd9407e6fbe82fe55cb0b938307aa0791f77","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200511-0006/","https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2020-002","https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4693","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VOE7P7APPRQKD4FGNHBKJPDY6FFCOH3W/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QPN2L2XVQGUA2V5HNQJWHK3APSK3VN7K/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-07/msg00067.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202007-03","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-07/msg00085.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rdf44341677cf7eec7e9aa96dcf3f37ed709544863d619cca8c36f133@%3Ccommits.airflow.apache.org%3E","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AVKYXLWCLZBV2N7M46KYK4LVA5OXWPBY/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SFP4UK4EGP4AFH2MWYJ5A5Z4I7XVFQ6B/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SAPQVX3XDNPGFT26QAQ6AJIXZZBZ4CD4/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rbb448222ba62c430e21e13f940be4cb5cfc373cd3bce56b48c0ffa67@%3Cdev.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r706cfbc098420f7113968cc377247ec3d1439bce42e679c11c609e2d@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-11/msg00039.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r49ce4243b4738dd763caeb27fa8ad6afb426ae3e8c011ff00b8b1f48@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2020-10","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2020-11","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2021.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r8f70b0f65d6bedf316ecd899371fd89e65333bc988f6326d2956735c@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r564585d97bc069137e64f521e68ba490c7c9c5b342df5d73c49a0760@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-02","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/03/msg00033.html","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/162159/jQuery-1.2-Cross-Site-Scripting.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/ree3bd8ddb23df5fa4e372d11c226830ea3650056b1059f3965b3fce2@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rede9cfaa756e050a3d83045008f84a62802fc68c17f2b4eabeaae5e4@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/re4ae96fa5c1a2fe71ccbb7b7ac1538bd0cb677be270a2bf6e2f8d108@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r54565a8f025c7c4f305355fdfd75b68eca442eebdb5f31c2e7d977ae@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-10","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html","https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r0483ba0072783c2e1bfea613984bfb3c86e73ba8879d780dc1cc7d36@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html"],"id":"CPANSA-JS-jQuery-2020-11022-jquery","affected_versions":["==1.2.6.001"],"reported":"2020-04-29","distribution":"JS-jQuery","description":"In jQuery versions greater than or equal to 1.2 and before 3.5.0, passing HTML from untrusted sources - even after sanitizing it - to one of jQuery's DOM manipulation methods (i.e. .html(), .append(), and others) may execute untrusted code.

When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n","cves":["CVE-2019-5428"],"severity":null,"affected_versions":["==1.2.6.001"],"reported":null,"distribution":"JS-jQuery"},{"affected_versions":["==1.2.6.001"],"reported":"2018-01-16","distribution":"JS-jQuery","description":"jQuery 1.4.2 allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via vectors related to use of the text method inside after.\n","cves":["CVE-2014-6071"],"severity":"medium","fixed_versions":[],"references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1136683","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Sep/10","https://help.ecostruxureit.com/display/public/UADCE725/Security+fixes+in+StruxureWare+Data+Center+Expert+v7.6.0"],"id":"CPANSA-JS-jQuery-2014-6071-jquery"}],"main_module":"JS::jQuery"},"Data-Entropy":{"versions":[{"date":"2006-07-19T01:09:30","version":"0.000"},{"date":"2006-08-03T20:27:12","version":"0.001"},{"version":"0.002","date":"2006-08-05T09:15:08"},{"version":"0.003","date":"2007-01-21T00:51:31"},{"version":"0.004","date":"2007-09-03T21:25:09"},{"version":"0.005","date":"2009-03-03T20:31:03"},{"date":"2009-11-21T14:01:52","version":"0.006"},{"date":"2011-04-27T20:03:17","version":"0.007"},{"date":"2025-03-27T19:11:37","version":"0.008"}],"main_module":"Data::Entropy","advisories":[{"cves":["CVE-2025-1860"],"severity":null,"description":"Data::Entropy for Perl 0.007 and earlier use the rand() function as the default source of entropy, which is notÂ cryptographically secure,Â for cryptographic functions.","distribution":"Data-Entropy","reported":"2025-03-28","affected_versions":["<=0.007"],"id":"CPANSA-Data-Entropy-2025-1860","references":["https://metacpan.org/release/ZEFRAM/Data-Entropy-0.007/source/lib/Data/Entropy.pm#L80","https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/rand","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2025/03/msg00026.html"],"fixed_versions":[">0.007"]}]},"PGObject-Util-DBAdmin":{"versions":[{"version":"0.01","date":"2014-09-11T11:20:13"},{"date":"2014-09-12T02:45:35","version":"0.02"},{"version":"0.03","date":"2014-09-13T02:03:16"},{"date":"2014-09-13T14:37:42","version":"0.04"},{"version":"0.05","date":"2014-09-14T07:48:28"},{"date":"2014-09-17T08:27:06","version":"0.06"},{"date":"2015-07-16T14:55:28","version":"0.07"},{"date":"2016-02-11T18:01:16","version":"0.08"},{"date":"2016-07-18T11:03:07","version":"0.09"},{"date":"2016-12-16T21:20:09","version":"v0.09.0"},{"version":"v0.10.0","date":"2016-12-16T21:36:46"},{"date":"2016-12-16T21:43:21","version":"v0.100.0"},{"date":"2018-03-31T14:06:25","version":"v0.120.0"},{"date":"2018-05-06T09:28:39","version":"v0.130.0"},{"date":"2018-06-05T19:29:29","version":"v0.130.1"},{"date":"2019-07-07T08:06:48","version":"v0.131.0"},{"version":"v1.0.0","date":"2019-07-08T20:46:34"},{"date":"2019-07-09T18:04:14","version":"v1.0.1"},{"version":"v1.0.2","date":"2019-09-20T06:49:02"},{"version":"v1.0.3","date":"2019-09-29T18:24:55"},{"date":"2020-09-21T21:20:33","version":"v1.1.0"},{"version":"v1.2.0","date":"2020-10-21T20:17:28"},{"version":"v1.2.1","date":"2020-10-21T22:24:41"},{"date":"2020-10-23T18:46:24","version":"v1.2.2"},{"version":"v1.2.3","date":"2020-10-24T07:08:10"},{"version":"v1.3.0","date":"2020-10-24T19:58:09"},{"version":"v1.4.0","date":"2020-10-25T12:15:26"},{"date":"2021-09-24T12:47:40","version":"v1.5.0"},{"date":"2021-11-07T12:22:17","version":"v1.6.0"},{"version":"v1.6.1","date":"2021-11-07T14:17:22"},{"version":"v1.6.2","date":"2024-09-13T19:24:01"}],"main_module":"PGObject::Util::DBAdmin","advisories":[{"description":"The PGObject::Util::DBAdmin module before 0.120.0 for Perl, as used in LedgerSMB through 1.5.x, insufficiently sanitizes or escapes variable values used as part of shell command execution, resulting in shell code injection via the create(), run_file(), backup(), or restore() function.

When that happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby leading to remote code execution.\n","severity":null,"cves":["CVE-2019-5428"],"reported":null,"affected_versions":[">=0.17,<=0.60"],"distribution":"Kossy","id":"CPANSA-Kossy-2019-5428-jquery","references":["https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-JQUERY-174006"],"fixed_versions":[]},{"fixed_versions":[],"references":["https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1136683","http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Sep/10","https://help.ecostruxureit.com/display/public/UADCE725/Security+fixes+in+StruxureWare+Data+Center+Expert+v7.6.0"],"id":"CPANSA-Kossy-2014-6071-jquery","reported":"2018-01-16","affected_versions":[">=0.17,<=0.60"],"distribution":"Kossy","description":"jQuery 1.4.2 allows remote attackers to conduct cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks via vectors related to use of the text method inside after.\n","severity":"medium","cves":["CVE-2014-6071"]},{"fixed_versions":[],"references":["https://github.com/jquery/jquery/security/advisories/GHSA-gxr4-xjj5-5px2","https://blog.jquery.com/2020/04/10/jquery-3-5-0-released/","https://jquery.com/upgrade-guide/3.5/","https://github.com/jquery/jquery/commit/1d61fd9407e6fbe82fe55cb0b938307aa0791f77","https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20200511-0006/","https://www.drupal.org/sa-core-2020-002","https://www.debian.org/security/2020/dsa-4693","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/VOE7P7APPRQKD4FGNHBKJPDY6FFCOH3W/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/QPN2L2XVQGUA2V5HNQJWHK3APSK3VN7K/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujul2020.html","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-07/msg00067.html","https://security.gentoo.org/glsa/202007-03","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-07/msg00085.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rdf44341677cf7eec7e9aa96dcf3f37ed709544863d619cca8c36f133@%3Ccommits.airflow.apache.org%3E","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/AVKYXLWCLZBV2N7M46KYK4LVA5OXWPBY/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SFP4UK4EGP4AFH2MWYJ5A5Z4I7XVFQ6B/","https://lists.fedoraproject.org/archives/list/package-announce@lists.fedoraproject.org/message/SAPQVX3XDNPGFT26QAQ6AJIXZZBZ4CD4/","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2020.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rbb448222ba62c430e21e13f940be4cb5cfc373cd3bce56b48c0ffa67@%3Cdev.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r706cfbc098420f7113968cc377247ec3d1439bce42e679c11c609e2d@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","http://lists.opensuse.org/opensuse-security-announce/2020-11/msg00039.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r49ce4243b4738dd763caeb27fa8ad6afb426ae3e8c011ff00b8b1f48@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2020-10","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2020-11","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2021.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r8f70b0f65d6bedf316ecd899371fd89e65333bc988f6326d2956735c@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r564585d97bc069137e64f521e68ba490c7c9c5b342df5d73c49a0760@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-02","https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/03/msg00033.html","http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/162159/jQuery-1.2-Cross-Site-Scripting.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/ree3bd8ddb23df5fa4e372d11c226830ea3650056b1059f3965b3fce2@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/rede9cfaa756e050a3d83045008f84a62802fc68c17f2b4eabeaae5e4@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/re4ae96fa5c1a2fe71ccbb7b7ac1538bd0cb677be270a2bf6e2f8d108@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r54565a8f025c7c4f305355fdfd75b68eca442eebdb5f31c2e7d977ae@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://www.tenable.com/security/tns-2021-10","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuApr2021.html","https://www.oracle.com//security-alerts/cpujul2021.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuoct2021.html","https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r0483ba0072783c2e1bfea613984bfb3c86e73ba8879d780dc1cc7d36@%3Cissues.flink.apache.org%3E","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpujan2022.html","https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/cpuapr2022.html"],"id":"CPANSA-Kossy-2020-11022-jquery","reported":"2020-04-29","affected_versions":[">=0.12,<=0.16"],"distribution":"Kossy","description":"In jQuery versions greater than or equal to 1.2 and before 3.5.0, passing HTML from untrusted sources -

Versions prior to 6.15 are subject to a vulnerability which could potentially be exploited to gain privileged access to APIs or poison intermediate caches. It is uncertain how large the risks are, most Perl based applications are served on top of Nginx or Apache, not on the `HTTP::Daemon`. This library is commonly used for local development and tests. Users are advised to update to resolve this issue. Users unable to upgrade may add additional request handling logic as a mitigation. After calling `my $rqst = $conn->get_request()` one could inspect the returned `HTTP::Request` object.
