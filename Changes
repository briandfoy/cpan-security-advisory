	* initial release. This breaks out the data portion of CPAN::Audit
	into a separate dist that can be updated independently. This maintains
	the CPAN::Audit::DB module (for now), creates a new module CPANSA::DB
	to replace it evenutally, and also distributes a JSON version of the
	database for people who want to use it without CPAN::Audit.
