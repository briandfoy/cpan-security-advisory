    This release reverts the addition of stream classes (added in
    7.83), which have unfortunately resulted in many Mojolicious
    applications becoming unstable. While there are no known exploits
    yet, we've chosen to err on the side of cautiousness and will
    classify this as a security issue.

    Mojolicious is vulnerable to cross-site scripting, caused by
    improper validation of user-supplied input by link_to helper. A
    remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a

    within the security context of the hosting Web site, once the URL
    is clicked. An attacker could use this vulnerability to steal the
    victim's cookie-based authentication credentials.
