    This release reverts the addition of stream classes (added in 7.83), which
    have unfortunately resulted in many Mojolicious applications becoming
    unstable. While there are no known exploits yet, we've chosen to err on the
    side of cautiousness and will classify this as a security issue.

  severity: high
  description: >
    Mojolicious is vulnerable to cross-site scripting, caused by improper validation of user-supplied input by link_to
    helper. A remote attacker could exploit this vulnerability using a specially-crafted URL to execute script in
    a victim's Web browser within the security context of the hosting Web site, once the URL is clicked. An attacker
    could use this vulnerability to steal the victim's cookie-based authentication credentials.
