    - CVE-2022-31081
  description: >
    HTTP::Daemon is a simple http server class written in perl.
    Versions prior to 6.15 are subject to a vulnerability which could
    potentially be exploited to gain privileged access to APIs or poison
    intermediate caches. It is uncertain how large the risks are, most
    Perl based applications are served on top of Nginx or Apache, not on
    the `HTTP::Daemon`. This library is commonly used for local
    development and tests. Users are advised to update to resolve this
    issue. Users unable to upgrade may add additional request handling
    logic as a mitigation. After calling `my $rqst = $conn->get_request()`
    one could inspect the returned `HTTP::Request` object. Querying the
    'Content-Length' (`my $cl = $rqst->header('Content-Length')`) will
    show any abnormalities that should be dealt with by a `400` response.
    Expected strings of 'Content-Length' SHOULD consist of either a single
    non-negative integer, or, a comma separated repetition of that number.
    (that is `42` or `42, 42, 42`). Anything else MUST be rejected.
