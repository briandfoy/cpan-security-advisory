    - CVE-2019-17362
  description: >
    In LibTomCrypt through 1.18.2, the der_decode_utf8_string function
    (in der_decode_utf8_string.c) does not properly detect certain
    invalid UTF-8 sequences. This allows context-dependent attackers
    to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and crash) or
    read information from other memory locations via carefully crafted
    DER-encoded data.
  comment: >
    From the author: "I have reviewed Dropbear's usage of libtomcrypt,
    and the function in question for CVE-2019-17362,
    der_decode_utf8_string, is not used in Dropbear. None of the DER
    parsing from libtomcrypt is used in Dropbear at all, I have
    confirmed that the flag to include it is not set, and confirmed
    that the resultant Dropbear.so that is built by Net::Dropbear does
    not include any of the der_* symbols."
