    comment: "From the author: \"I have reviewed Dropbear's usage of libtomcrypt, and the function in question for CVE-2019-17362, der_decode_utf8_string, is not used in Dropbear. None of the DER parsing from libtomcrypt is used in Dropbear at all, I have confirmed that the flag to include it is not set, and confirmed that the resultant Dropbear.so that is built by Net::Dropbear does not include any of the der_* symbols.\"\n"
    cves:
      - CVE-2019-17362
    description: "In LibTomCrypt through 1.18.2, the der_decode_utf8_string function (in der_decode_utf8_string.c) does not properly detect certain invalid UTF-8 sequences. This allows context-dependent attackers to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and crash) or read information from other memory locations via carefully crafted DER-encoded data.\n"
