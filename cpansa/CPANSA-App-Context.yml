  description: |
    The App::Context module 0.01 through 0.968 for Perl does not properly use the Storable::thaw function, which allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted request to (1) App::Session::Cookie or (2) App::Session::HTMLHidden, which is not properly handled when it is deserialized.
