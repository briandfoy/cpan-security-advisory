    The App::Context module 0.01 through 0.968 for Perl does not
    properly use the Storable::thaw function, which allows remote
    attackers to execute arbitrary code via a crafted request to (1)
    App::Session::Cookie or (2) App::Session::HTMLHidden, which is not
    properly handled when it is deserialized.
