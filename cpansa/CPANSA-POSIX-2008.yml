    POSIX::2008's implementation of readlink()
    and readlinkat(). The underlying syscalls do not add any null terminator
    byte at the end of the output buffer, but _readlink50c() in 2008.XS also
    fails to add a null terminator before returning the result string to perl.
    This results in arbitrary memory contents being visible in the result
    returned to perl code by readlink() and readlinkat(). At the very least,
    this causes failures in any downstream code that attempts to access
    whatever filename (plus the erroneous garbage) was linked to.
