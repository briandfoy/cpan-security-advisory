  description: >
    Untrusted search path vulnerability in the installation
    functionality in ActivePerl 5.16.1.1601, when installed in the
    top-level C:\ directory, allows local users to gain privileges via
    a Trojan horse DLL in the C:\Perl\Site\bin directory, which is
    added to the PATH system environment variable, as demonstrated by
    a Trojan horse wlbsctrl.dll file used by the "IKE and AuthIP IPsec
    Keying Modules" system service in Windows Vista SP1, Windows
    Server 2008 SP2, Windows 7 SP1, and Windows 8 Release Preview.

  description: >
    ActivePerl 5.8.x and others, and Larry Wall's Perl 5.6.1 and
    others, when running on Windows systems, allows attackers to cause
    a denial of service (crash) and possibly execute arbitrary code
    via a long argument to the system command, which leads to a
    stack-based buffer overflow.  NOTE: it is unclear whether this bug
    is in Perl or the OS API that is used by Perl.
