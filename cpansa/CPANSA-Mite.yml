      - CVE-2025-30672
    description: "Mite for Perl before 0.013000 generates code with the current working directory ('.') added to the @INC path similar to CVE-2016-1238.  If an attacker can place a malicious file in current working directory, it may be  loaded instead of the intended file, potentially leading to arbitrary  code execution.  This affects the Mite distribution itself, and other distributions that contain code generated by Mite."
