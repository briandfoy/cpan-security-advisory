  description: >
    lib/MT/Upgrade.pm in mt-upgrade.cgi in Movable Type 4.2x and 4.3x
    through 4.38 does not require authentication for requests to
    database-migration functions, which allows remote attackers to
    conduct eval injection and SQL injection attacks via crafted
    parameters, as demonstrated by an eval injection attack against
    the core_drop_meta_for_table function, leading to execution of
    arbitrary Perl code.
