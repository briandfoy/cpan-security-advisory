  severity: high
  description: >
    Crypt::Perl::ECDSA in the Crypt::Perl (aka p5-Crypt-Perl) module
    before 0.32 for Perl fails to verify correct ECDSA signatures when
    r and s are small and when s = 1. This happens when using the
    curve secp256r1 (prime256v1). This could conceivably have a
    security-relevant impact if an attacker wishes to use public r and
    s values when guessing whether signature verification will fail.
