  description: >
    A timing-based side-channel flaw exists in the
    perl-Crypt-OpenSSL-RSA package, which could be sufficient to recover
    plaintext across a network in a Bleichenbacher-style attack. To
    achieve successful decryption, an attacker would have to be able to
    send a large number of trial messages. The vulnerability affects the
    legacy PKCS#1v1.5 RSA encryption padding mode.
