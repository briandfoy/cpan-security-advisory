      - CVE-2025-40933
    description: 'Apache::AuthAny::Cookie v0.201 or earlier for Perl generates session ids insecurely.  Session ids are generated using an MD5 hash of the epoch time and a call to the built-in rand function. The epoch time may be guessed, if it is not leaked from the HTTP Date header. The built-in rand function is unsuitable for cryptographic usage.  Predicable session ids could allow an attacker to gain access to systems.'
