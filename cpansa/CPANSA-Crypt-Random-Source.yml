  - CVE-2018-25107
  description: |
    In versions prior to 0.13, rand could be used as a result of calling get_weak, or get, if no random device was available. This implies that not explicitly asking for get_strong on a non POSIX operating system (e.g. Win32 without the Win32 backend) could have resulted in non cryptographically random data.
