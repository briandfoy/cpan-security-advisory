  - CVE-2011-0633
  description: |
    The Net::HTTPS module in libwww-perl (LWP) before 6.00, as used in WWW::Mechanize, LWP::UserAgent, and other products, when running in environments that do not set the If-SSL-Cert-Subject header, does not enable full validation of SSL certificates by default, which allows remote attackers to spoof servers via man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks involving hostnames that are not properly validated.

  - CVE-2010-2253
  description: |
    lwp-download in libwww-perl before 5.835 does not reject downloads to filenames that begin with a . (dot) character, which allows remote servers to create or overwrite files via (1) a 3xx redirect to a URL with a crafted filename or (2) a Content-Disposition header that suggests a crafted filename, and possibly execute arbitrary code as a consequence of writing to a dotfile in a home directory.

    If LWP::UserAgent::env_proxy is called in a CGI environment, the case-insensitivity when looking for "http_proxy" permits "HTTP_PROXY" to be found, but this can be trivially set by the web client using the "Proxy:" header.
