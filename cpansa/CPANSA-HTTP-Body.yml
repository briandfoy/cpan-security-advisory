  severity: moderate
  description: >
    HTTP::Body::Multipart in the HTTP-Body 1.08, 1.22, and earlier
    module for Perl uses the part of the uploaded file's name after
    the first "." character as the suffix of a temporary file, which
    makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct attacks by
    leveraging subsequent behavior that may assume the suffix is
    well-formed.
