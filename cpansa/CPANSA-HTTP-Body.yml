  description: |
    HTTP::Body::Multipart in the HTTP-Body 1.08, 1.22, and earlier module for Perl uses the part of the uploaded file's name after the first "." character as the suffix of a temporary file, which makes it easier for remote attackers to conduct attacks by leveraging subsequent behavior that may assume the suffix is well-formed.
