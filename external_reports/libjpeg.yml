    description: >
      The get_sos function in jdmarker.c in (1) libjpeg 6b and (2)
      libjpeg-turbo through 1.3.0, as used in Google Chrome before
      31.0.1650.48, Ghostscript, and other products, does not check for
      certain duplications of component data during the reading of segments
      that follow Start Of Scan (SOS) JPEG markers, which allows remote
      attackers to obtain sensitive information from uninitialized memory
      locations via a crafted JPEG image.
