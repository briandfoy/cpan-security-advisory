    description: >
      Prototype Pollution is a vulnerability affecting
      JavaScript. Prototype Pollution refers to the ability to inject
      properties into existing JavaScript language construct prototypes,
      such as objects. JavaScript allows all Object attributes to be
      altered, including their magical attributes such as _proto_,
      constructor and prototype. An attacker manipulates these
      attributes to overwrite, or pollute, a JavaScript application
      object prototype of the base object by injecting other
      values. Properties on the Object.prototype are then inherited by
      all the JavaScript objects through the prototype chain. When that
      happens, this leads to either denial of service by triggering
      JavaScript exceptions, or it tampers with the application source
      code to force the code path that the attacker injects, thereby
      leading to remote code execution.
