    description: >
      React applications which rendered to HTML using the
      ReactDOMServer API were not escaping user-supplied attribute names at
      render-time. That lack of escaping could lead to a cross-site
      scripting vulnerability. This issue affected minor releases 16.0.x,
      16.1.x, 16.2.x, 16.3.x, and 16.4.x. It was fixed in 16.0.1, 16.1.2,
      16.2.1, 16.3.3, and 16.4.2.
