  - cve: CVE-2018-7159
    description: >
      The HTTP parser in all current versions of Node.js ignores spaces
      in the `Content-Length` header, allowing input such as
      `Content-Length: 1 2` to be interpreted as having a value of
      `12`. The HTTP specification does not allow for spaces in the
      `Content-Length` value and the Node.js HTTP parser has been
      brought into line on this particular difference. The security risk
      of this flaw to Node.js users is considered to be VERY LOW as it
      is difficult, and may be impossible, to craft an attack that makes
      use of this flaw in a way that could not already be achieved by
      supplying an incorrect value for `Content-Length`. Vulnerabilities
      may exist in user-code that make incorrect assumptions about the
      potential accuracy of this value compared to the actual length of
      the data supplied. Node.js users crafting lower-level HTTP
      utilities are advised to re-check the length of any input supplied
      after parsing is complete.'

  - cve: CVE-2018-12121
    description: >
      Denial of Service with large HTTP headers by using a combination
      of many requests with maximum sized headers (almost 80 KB per
      connection), and carefully timed completion of the headers, it is
      possible to cause the HTTP server to abort from heap allocation
      failure. Attack potential is mitigated by the use of a load
      balancer or other proxy layer.
