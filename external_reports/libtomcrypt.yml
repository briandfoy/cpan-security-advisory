- cve: CVE-2019-17362
  description: >
    In LibTomCrypt through 1.18.2, the der_decode_utf8_string function
    (in der_decode_utf8_string.c) does not properly detect certain
    invalid UTF-8 sequences. This allows context-dependent attackers
    to cause a denial of service (out-of-bounds read and crash) or
    read information from other memory locations via carefully crafted
    DER-encoded data.

- cve: CVE-2018-12437
  description: >
    LibTomCrypt through 1.18.1 allows a memory-cache side-channel
    attack on ECDSA signatures, aka the Return Of the Hidden Number
    Problem or ROHNP. To discover an ECDSA key, the attacker needs
    access to either the local machine or a different virtual machine
    on the same physical host.

- cve: CVE-2016-6129
  description: >
    The rsa_verify_hash_ex function in rsa_verify_hash.c in
    LibTomCrypt, as used in OP-TEE before 2.2.0, does not validate
    that the message length is equal to the ASN.1 encoded data length,
    which makes it easier for remote attackers to forge RSA signatures
    or public certificates by leveraging a Bleichenbacher signature
    forgery attack.
